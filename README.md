This project provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** applied to a **Personal Organization Tool**. By transitioning from high-level planning to technical deployment, the project demonstrates how structured methodology ensures software quality and functional consistency.

### 📑 Strategic Foundation: Phases 1 & 2

The project began by defining a clear **Project Goal**: creating a lightweight, accessible web tool for students and professionals.

* **Feasibility & Scope:** A web-based approach was selected for cross-device compatibility, supported by a relational database for persistent storage.
* **Requirement Specification (SRS):** A strict nomenclature was established (referring to data as `TaskItem`). Functional requirements focused on the "Create, Read, and Delete" (CRD) lifecycle, while non-functional requirements prioritized a mobile-responsive, minimalist UI.


### 🛠️ Technical Architecture: Phase 3

The **Design Phase** translated these requirements into a technical blueprint:

* **Architectural Pattern:** Implementation of the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern to separate data management, user interface, and business logic.
* **Data Structure:** A focused database schema (`TaskTable`) was designed using a `TaskID` (Primary Key) and `TaskContent`.
* **UX Strategy:** A **Single-Page Application (SPA)** model was chosen to enhance user experience by eliminating page reloads.


### 💻 Execution & Quality Control: Phases 4 & 5

During **Implementation**, the design was converted into functional code, ensuring "Nomenclature Synchronization"—matching variable names in the logic to the database schema.

The **Testing Phase** utilized a three-tier verification process:

1. **Unit Testing:** Isolated logic checks for database updates.
2. **Integration Testing:** Ensuring the UI buttons communicated correctly with the backend.
3. **UAT:** Real-world validation to ensure the interface was intuitive for the end-user.

### 🚀 Release & Evolution: Phase 6

The project culminated in a formal **Deployment** to GitHub, tagged as **v1.0.0**.

* **Lifecycle Continuity:** The summary highlights that the SDLC is cyclical. Maintenance involves monitoring current performance, while any new feature requests (such as "Due Dates") would trigger a return to the Planning phase, restarting the cycle.
